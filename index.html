        <img src="css/about_me_pic.JPG" alt="Picture of me">
        <h3><span>Hello&#128075 My name is Fizry. I am a 22-year-old male living in Singapore (one of the most expensive countries in
            the world). I graduated from Republic Polytechnic in 2021 with a Diploma in Infocomm Security Management. During my free time, I 
            would keep myself occupied by attending courses (From either HackTheBox or codeRed). If I'm not doing either of that, I would 
            play some computer games (E.g Cities Skylines or Planet Coaster) or spend time with my friends and loved ones. Currently, I am serving 
            my national service with the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and due to ORD in less than six months. I plan to continue my studies if 
            not find a job related to my course.<br><br>During my polytechnic days, I was given the privilege to intern as a security engineer 
            at Tindo Pte Ltd. A respectable company with a business goal of providing the most trustworthy cybersecurity solutions and 
            services. I worked on one of their internal projects, DevOps. From there, I then started to learn what the methodology was about 
            and how to implement it in an existing organization. Needless to say, my learning experience at Tindo Pte Ltd was very fruitful 
            and informative. I do wish to continue learning more about DevOps and DevOpsSec so that I can broaden my understanding of the methodology.</span></h3>

                    <p>Project Graduate was my final year project at Republic Polytechnic. The project is about creating a Real-Time Threat Feed Malware 
                        Analysis System. The purpose is to allow personnel from security operations control (SOC) to quickly react to IOCs detected within 
                        the network. So as to prevent (further) compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.<br><br>The goal for my end of 
                        the project is to be able to (1) "Pull" indicators of compromise (IOC) feeds from threat intelligence sites (E.g. AlienVault, 
                        VirusTotal.com). (2) Use commercially available data platforms (E.g. Splunk) to analyze network traffic for phishing emails/websites/etc. 
                        (3) Correlate & classify the traffic (4) Present it on an interactive dashboard to visualize the correlation with the additional help 
                        of a GeoMap.<br><br>
                        Project Graduate has taught me:
                        <ul>
                            <li>IOCs - Different Types, what do they mean and where to find them.</li>
                            <li>Using API to pull the data off intelligence sites and upload it automatically onto Splunk.</li>
                            <li>Using Python to correlate the data from intelligence sites and network traffic.</li>
                            <li>Configure Splunk's Interactive Dashboard.</li>

                    <p>Project Auth is a personal project that I created whilst waiting to be enlisted for National Service(NS). The name Project Auth 
                        comes from the first four letters of both authentication and authorization. Its aim is to educate its users on the difference 
                        between authentication and authorization, and how to apply it to real-world contexts.<br><br>To achieve its purpose, the web application 
                        will contain different pages, each depicting a different method of authentication or authorization. With each method being depicted, 
                        a real-world context into how the method is implemented will be demonstrated to its user. Allowing them(the users) to have a clearer 
                        and better understanding of the method. Still, in its development stage, the project has so far completed its theory portion and is 
                        now 30% completed with the practical portion. Documentation of the project and its processes will soon be available once the web 
                        applications are cleared of bugs.<br><br>

                    <p>Project Arm Fling is the first personal project which I have generated while serving NS. Its aim is for me to familiarise myself 
                        with VMware ESXi (An industrial bare-metal hypervisor that is commonly used among organizations). One interesting fact about this 
                        project is that it uses a Raspberry Pi 8GB to run the bare-metal hypervisor. The reason why I thought this would be a good idea 
                        is that (1) the cost of the components used in the project is roughly the same as a second-hand laptop. (2) It's customizable (I'm 
                        able to add more data stores simply by plugging in a 128/1TB thumb drive or SSD). (3) I thought it would be pretty cool to use 
                        a Raspberry Pi to run VMware ESXi.<br><br>Project Arm Fling primarily focuses on the installation and configuration of the Raspberry Pi. 
                        My thoughts on the next phase of this project will be to start creating virtual machines(VMs) that run an array of services (E.g. 
                        MySQL Database, Apache Web Server, Dockers Server, Kubernetes Server, The possibilities are endless). Documentation of the project 
                        and its step-by-step installation & configuration guide will soon be available. Regular updates to the guide will also be made to 
                        keep you updated.<br><br>

                    <p>Project Showcase is the second personal project which I have produced while serving NS. The goal for this project was to act as a 
                        public portfolio for educational institutions & organizations to get to know more about me and my work. One remarkable fact about 
                        this website (if you already didn't notice) is that it is running on GitHub Pages. GitHub Pages is a service that allows its users 
                        to run a website directly from its repository.<br><br>One awesome fact about GitHub Pages is that you don't even need to know HTML to create 
                        a website. GitHub Pages employs an open-source tool called "Jekyll" that turns plain text into websites, blogs, or structured documentation. 
                        But wait, there's more! If you are an existing GitHub user, all the traditional GitHub tools and workflows remain the same, you can even 
                        write tests for GitHub which will send you a report before you merge your codes.<br><br>GitHub will automatically create and deploy your website 
                        for you. It allows you to focus on the content of your webpage rather than stressing out on the build and deployment of your website. 
                        Normally I end my summary with a list of facts or knowledge which I have gained from the project. But Project Showcase is not about 
                        showing what I have learned, but instead showcasing the journey I have been through to my future educators or executives.</p>
