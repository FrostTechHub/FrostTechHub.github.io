                <div class="summary">
                    <p>Project Threat Feed is about using an opensource monitoring system (Splunk) to display real-time threat alerts and statistics 
                        about the network. Using IOC data pulled from threat intelligence sites (AlienVault, VirusTotal.com), scripts then correlate 
                        the data and display it as either alerts or statistics in the Splunk dashboard. The purpose of developing such systems is to 
                        allow personnel from security operations control (SOC) to quickly react threats detected in the network.
                        <br><br>
                        Upon completion of this project, Project Threat Feed has taught me:

                            <li>Using API to pull data off intelligence sites</li>
                            <li>Using python-based scripts to upload and download data as well as correlate them</li>
                            <li>Configuring Splunk’s Interactive dashboard</li>

                    <p>Project Auth is about educating students the difference between authentication and authorization. Whilst providing them with 
                        real-world context on how to apply them. Project Auth is based off a web application where students can access either the 
                        Authentication or Authorization page. Within the page itself there are different examples displayed to students the different 
                        types of authentication and authorization methods. Still in its development phase, Project Auth hopes to achieve a clearer understanding 
                        for students.

                    <p>Project Arm Fling is about creating a virtual lab environment using VMware ESXi (Type 1 Hypervisor) and a Raspberry Pi. With the creation 
                        of this lab environment, experiments such as creating and running different types of malwares and software will be possible. 
                        Furthermore, with VMware ESXi, creating virtual routers & switches will allow me to strengthen and boost my networking foundations. Lastly, 
                        having installed VMware ESXi on a Raspberry Pi offers the opportunity to expand and add a second. Thus, forming a cluster. A 
                        documentation of the project will be published soon.
